# ChatDB [![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://chat-db.streamlit.app/)
A web app built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that allows you to chat with your databases using a GPT model.

## Features
- Chat with your [GPT model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) of choice
- Ask about anything in your databases, and the bot will answer

&nbsp;
- View the results *and* the SQL queries that the GPT model generated
  - SQL queries are added below the bot's response

  &nbsp;
  - Expand the box to see the query and the result the bot received

  &nbsp;
  - If the model accidentally generates an invalid query or the query fails, the error will be displayed (example: `apartments` table is not in the database)

  &nbsp;
  - GPT 3.5 turbo (the default model) is really good at generating complex SQL queries from your questions, so just ask away!

- Locally backup and restore your conversations and settings (API keys are encrypted before backup)

- Go to the **‚öôÔ∏è Settings** page
- Provide your OpenAI API key, and add a vector store and some database connnections
- Go to the **ü§ñ Chats** page
- Create a new conversation by specifying the GPT model and selecting a vector store and database connections
